**1. DAILY STARTUP PROCEDURES**

**Check Reagents**

1. Check the volume of HCl in the amber bottle. You will
     need at least 50mL to process a single sample (30mL for initial purging
     procedure and ~5mL for each subsequent sample). 

2.    
Swirl the HCL amber
bottle to mix the acid with any droplets that may have condensed onto the
glass.

1. Check the hose in the HCL amber bottle to ensure it
     reaches the bottom of the bottle.

**_IMPORTANT_**: If the volume of HCl is below the halfway
mark, please submit a purchase request for more acid, as there is significant
lead time for receiving new orders of HCl.

**Start LabX Software, Titrator, and Rondolino**

1. Login in to the srlab account on the computer next to
     the titrator and open LabX.
2. Turn the titrator on (button on front of cube).
3. Turn the Rondolino on (switch on rear, lower right). It
     will perform a brief system check, where the probes will raise, and the
     carousel will rotate, before returning the probes and carousel to their
     original positions.
4. If a sample cup is not already present, press the left
     blue button on top of the Rondolino (rotates carousel 180˚) and place an
     empty cup for HCL at position 0. Rotate the carousel back to position 0.

_Tip: if no rotation occurs, check the wire
connections at the back of the Rondolino._

**Prepare the Titrator**

1.     Examine all red tubing for bubbles. Any
bubbles must be removed to ensure accurate volume measurements during
titrations. 

2.     On the titrator touchscreen, select PURGE 3x from the home screen, accept the defaults and
push START. 

3.     Agitate the tubing by flicking or lightly
tapping areas with bubbles to aid their expulsion.

4.     Repeat steps 1-3 until all bubbles are purged.
After three purge cycles, the 100 mL sample cup must be emptied as described in
step 5 before continuing to purge the lines.

5.     Rotate the carousel and empty the HCL cup by removing
the HCL amber bottle stopper and carefully pouring the HCL back into the
bottle. Replace the stopper. 

1. Rinse
     the acid cup with DI water and leave inverted on drying rack above sink
     when finished.

**2. Calibrate the pH probe and Measure CRMs
(CO2 Reference Materials)**

**Calibrate the pH Meter**

1. Place a DI water cup with 60mL DI water at position 0. 
2. Check the date of the pH buffers in the conical tubes.
     Discard the buffers and replace them if they are more than 3 days old. Place
     each buffer in cups and place the cups in positions 1 (pH 7.0), 2 (pH
     4.0), and 3 (pH 10.0) of the sample changer.
    - _The order of the buffers is
      critical!_

3. CAREFULLY open the small gray cap on the pH probe, add
     KCl if needed; the liquid inside the pH probe should be within or above
     the frosted glass portion.
4. Insert the probe behind the Temperature Sensor and
     either across from, or in front of the acid line. Open the gray cap on the
     side of pH probe. The stirrer stirs clockwise, so in order to get accurate
     readings, the acid line should not be directly behind the pH probe
5. On the LabX main page, click on analysis (bottom left
     of the screen) and method (top left of screen). Select the calibration
     method (pH Cal) and click on the green start button at the top of the
     screen
6. On the LABX main page, top left - click on the Work
     Bench to see the sample being measured.
7. For the buffers, a variation between 0 and 0.3 is
     acceptable. If it is greater than that, use newer buffers and repeat the
     calibration process.
8. When the calibration is completed, on the LABX
     mainscreen, open the DATA and click on Result Sets from the Last 24 hours.
     
9. Double click the pH calibration results and select the
     Raw Data tab. Select Print Data Tab then Export To and choose PDF. 
10. Plug in a USB drive and save the data in folder
     labelled with the data “YEARMONTHDAY/” as “pHcal”.
11. In the results details section you will have the values
     for the slope and zero point, record the second value on the logging sheet.
12. In the measured values section you will have the
     results for each pH buffer. Record the E value for each pH on the logging
     sheet.
13. Record the measured temperature of the buffers during
     the calibration.

**Measure CRM samples**

1. Take the sample cups ‘Junk Seawater’, ‘CRM 1’, and ‘CRM
     2’ and a serological pipette and pipettor to the scale.
2. Add between 59-61 g of seawater into the ‘Junk
     Seawater’ cup. This is a backup in case any bubbles were missed during
     titrator preparation. Record the mass.
3. Record the batch number of the CRM. Carefully pipette
     between 59-61 g of CRM into each CRM cup. Record both masses.

**_CAUTION:_**CRMs are poisoned with mercury (II) chloride and should be
handled with care!

1. The DI water from pH calibration should be in position
     0. Place the ‘Junk Seawater’ sample in position 1, and ‘CRM 1’ and ‘CRM 2’
     in positions 2 and 3 respectively. 
2. Click on analysis then method on the LabX main page. Right
     click on “007” and click start. 
3. Change the number of samples to 3. Name the samples
     “JUNK”, “CRM 1”, and “CRM 2” in order. Enter the mass of each sample.
     Click start to begin titrating.
4. Once the titration of all samples is completed, the
     output file will be saved onto the desktop as “YEARMONTHDAY_CRM.csv”. Copy
     this file into the “YEARMONTHDAY/” folder created on your flash drive for
     the pH calibration.
5. Dispose of the CRM samples in the toxic waste
     container. Rinse with DI water and discard into the toxic waste container
     to ensure no mercuric acid goes down the drain. 
6. Discard the seawater sample down the drain and rinse
     the cup.

 **Check the Titrator’s error rate**

1.     Put your flash drive into a computer with a
cloned Seawater-Chemistry-Analysis repo.

2.     Create a file for masses called
“YEARMONTHDAYmass_CRM with the columns “sample”, “mass”, “salinity”, “Sample.ID”,
“Type” and “Notes” and add it to today’s folder. 

3.     Enter in the measurements for each sample. Salinity
values can be found by looking up the CRM batch number created by the Dickson Lab.
Assume 29.000 ppm for the “JUNK” sample.

o   _The
sample ID column must match what you entered into the computer for the
titration._

4.     Open the R script “Apex_Water_Chem_MONTH-DAY_YEAR…/”.
Change line 27 to today’s date and confirm your mass and titration output file
names in lines 30-32.

5.     Run the script through line 138. An output
file called “TA_Output_YEARMONTHDAY_CRM.csv” will be created in today’s folder.

6.     Open the output file and enter the Batch
number and alkalinity value of the batch in a new line. Make two rows for the
“CRM 1 Error” and “CRM 2 Error”. 

7.     Calculate the error by (Batch alkalinity – CRM
# TA)/Batch alkalinity*100. An error of 1% or less is acceptable. If the error
is above 1%, the pH calibration and/or the CRM measurements must be redone.

**_IMPORTANT_**: If CRM is running low, please submit a purchase request for
more, as there is significant lead time for receiving new orders.

**3. Running Water Samples**

1.     Prepare another JUNK
sample with 59-61 g seawater in the “Junk Seawater cup” and place it in
position 0. Add 59-61 g of water sample to clean, dry sample cups and place in
sequential positions. Up to 8 samples can be run at once. Record all masses.

o  
If you are taking discrete measurements, makes sure your water
sample was collected at the same time the discrete measurements were taken.

1. Click
     on analysis then method on the LabX main page. Right click on “007” and
     click start. 
2. Enter
     the number of samples being run and enter sample IDs and masses. Click
     start to begin titrating. 
3. Once
     the titration of all samples is completed, the output file will be saved
     onto the desktop as “YEARMONTHDAY_CRM.csv”. Copy this file into today’s
     folder to obtain your alkalinity data.
4. Discard
     samples, rinse cups and invert on a drying rack for later use. 

**_CAUTION: _**If samples have been poisoned, they must be discarded in the
toxic waste container!

6.    
Place the HCL cup at
position 0 to catch any drips from the titrator tube. Store the pH probe based
on time until next titrator use.

**_pH Probe Storage Procedures_**

- Temporary (No longer than a week) - can stay in the
     Rondolino in pH 4.0 Buffer
- Medium-term (No longer than a month) - move to the pH
     probe holder on the titrator, close gray cap
- Long-term (Longer than a month) - move to the pH probe
     holder on the titrator and place clear cap over the end containing KCl,
     close gray cap

7.      
Shut down the
computer, Rondolino, and titrator.
